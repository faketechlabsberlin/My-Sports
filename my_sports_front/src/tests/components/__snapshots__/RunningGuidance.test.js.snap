    1 star running - I’m a complete beginner, speed is not so important to me, I would like to get outside and move a bit.
  </p>
  <p className=\\"text-center\\">
    2 star running - I enjoy running from time to time and to get the heart rate up at jogging speeds.
  </p>
  <p className=\\"text-center\\">
    3 star running - I have been running for a while, I like to push the tempo and meet my time goals.
  </p>
  <p className=\\"text-center\\">
    4 star running - I am a fast runner and I will work my hardest at middle and long distance efforts. I enjoy a race.
  </p>
  <p className=\\"text-center\\">
    5 star running - I’m a speed machine. I have racing experience and perhaps I’m capable of a marathon. Looking for other like minded racers to push me.
